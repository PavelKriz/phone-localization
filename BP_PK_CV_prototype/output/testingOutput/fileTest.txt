======DETECTIG AND DESCRIBING FEATURES======
    
=========object=========
        CImage with filepath: input_images\dum_rott\dumRottScene2.jpg is being processed.
        CLAHE was applied on the image.Detection and description done, keypoints count: 1000
        
=========scenes=========
        CImage with filepath: input_images\dum_rott\dumRottRef.png is being processed.
        CLAHE was applied on the image.Detection and description done, keypoints count: 1000
        CImage with filepath: input_images\white_house\whiteHouse1ref.png is being processed.
        CLAHE was applied on the image.Detection and description done, keypoints count: 1000
        
=========timing=========
        Detecting and describing all features took: 269[ms]
        
======MATCHING======
    
    Matching scene with object that has filepath: input_images\dum_rott\dumRottRef.png
    Max distance :87.000000
    Min distance :14.000000
    Average distance :60.251748
    Average first to second ratio is  :0.910271
    Ratio of filtered matches to number of keypoints of object is (x100):4.300000
    Compare index: 0 | avarage distance: 60.251748
    
    Matching scene with object that has filepath: input_images\white_house\whiteHouse1ref.png
    Max distance :88.000000
    Min distance :33.000000
    Average distance :63.987013
    Average first to second ratio is  :0.938901
    Ratio of filtered matches to number of keypoints of object is (x100):0.100000
    Compare index: 1 | avarage distance: 63.987013
    
=========timing=========
        Finding the right object took: 5[ms]
        Time of the whole process: 274[ms]
        
=========result=========
        Best object match for scene is object with filepath: input_images\dum_rott\dumRottRef.png
        
=========timing=========
        Result output took: 11[ms]
        Time of the whole process with view: 285[ms]
