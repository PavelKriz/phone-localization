OpenCV version : 4.5.2
TIMING: OFF (speed optimalisation)
NOTE: When is TIMING ON the images are not saved and also the processing might be slightly faster than without timing optimalisation

======PARAMETERS OF USED ALGORITHMS======
    Method used for detecting: SIFT
    Method used for extracting/describing: BEBLID
    Method used for matching: brute force matching
    
    SIFT parameters are following:
    note: defaut value means that it wasnt changed, other walua can be also euqal to the default ones
    nFeatures: 1000
    nOctaveLayers_: 3 (default value)
    contrastThreshold_: 0.040000 (default value)
    edgeTreshold_: 10.000000 (default value)
    sigma_: 1.600000 (default value)
    
    BEBLID parameters are following:
    note: defaut value means that it wasnt changed, other walua can be also euqal to the default ones
    scale_factor_: 6.750000 (value to describe SIFT features)
    n_bits_: 512 bits size (defalut value)
