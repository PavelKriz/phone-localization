OpenCV version : 4.5.2
TIMING: OFF (speed optimalisation)
NOTE: When is TIMING ON the images are not saved and also the processing might be slightly faster than without timing optimalisation

======PARAMETERS OF USED ALGORITHMS======
    Method used for detecting: SIFT
    Method used for extracting/describing: SIFT
    Method used for matching: BF_matching
    
    SIFT parameters are following:
    note: defaut value means that it wasnt changed, other walua can be also euqal to the default ones
    nFeatures: 0 (OpenCV defaults: SIFT = 0 (means no limit), ORB = 1000)
    nOctaveLayers_: 3 (default value)
    contrastThreshold_: 0.040000 (default value)
    edgeTreshold_: 10.000000 (default value)
    sigma_: 1.600000 (default value)
    
    camera focal length: 4.000000
    camera sensors size x: 4.960000
    camera sensors size y: 3.720000
